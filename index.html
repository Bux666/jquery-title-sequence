  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This simple plugin simplifies the creation of animated title sequences in
  the style of opening titles or closing credits for a movie.</p>

  <p>Typical elements you might include in a title sequence are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>adding text (or image etc) at particular x/y coordinates</li>
    <li>fading text in/out by animating opacity</li>
    <li>scrolling text up/down by animating the position</li>
    <li>wiping text in/out by animating the element width</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The plugin allows you to define a sequence of events such as
  adding/removing elements; initiating animations of particular CSS properties
  over a specified period; pausing for a specified period.</p>

  <p>Anything that can be included in HTML can be included in a title sequence.
  All styling can be applied using CSS as normal.</p>

  <p>The examples directory include some demos to get you started.</p>
