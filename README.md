jquery.titlesequence.js
=======================

This simple plugin simplifies the creation of animated title sequences in
the style of opening titles or closing credits for a movie.

Typical elements you might include in a title sequence are:

 * adding text (or image etc) at particular x/y coordinates
 * fading text in/out by animating opacity
 * scrolling text up/down by animating the position
 * wiping text in/out by animating the element width

The plugin allows you to define a sequence of events such as adding/removing
elements; initiating animations of particular CSS properties over a specified
period; pausing for a specified period.

Anything that can be included in HTML can be included in a title sequence.  All
styling can be applied using CSS as normal.

The examples directory include some demos to get you started.
